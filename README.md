# team-profile-generator

## Description

This task was meant to help generate team-profile-apps as a way to have quick access to every members contact and info. With a ready made app generator it removes the need of travelling through another page and changing details; instead, it creates a new app with new info without the headache of looking in the code.

This app, although unfinished, demanded an understanding of npm packages, dependencies and tests (to build professional apps).

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Clone the repo and install npm. Travel to the 'starter' directory and run in the terminal 'node index.js' and answer the prompts.

This is unfinished so currently it will only ask you questions without rendering anything. 

## Credits

I have checked out this repo ---> https://github.com/cdfishe1/team-generator ---> to get an idea of how the order of functions would work as I've had many failed attempts. I was happy to see I landed on the right track as I had similar thoughts of nesting multiple inquirers (never quite made it to rendering the html).
